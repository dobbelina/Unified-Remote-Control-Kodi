# Unified-Remote-Kodi
I made my own customized **Unified Remote** for Kodi on Windows.

All the yellow buttons have double functionality depending on "tap" or "onhold", see description below.

# Double Functionality
Button | Ontap | Onhold
--- |  --- | ---
![icon](images/stop.png) | Stop | Mark Watched
![icon](images/sub.png) | Enable/Disable subtitle | Subtitle position
![icon](images/codec.png) | Codec info 1 | Codec info 2
![icon](images/win.png) | Windows key | Focus Kodi
